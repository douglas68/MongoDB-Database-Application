# Wellness Check-In 
This is a tracker where a person recrds a daily "check-in"  It also lets you know how long of a streak you have. 

I completed the User and Reflection routes. Along the way I hit several errors caused by inconsistent names (singular vs. plural, file casing, and mismatches between model, route, and data exports). I resolved these by standardizing names and fixing imports. In hindsight, a simple naming tracker wouldâ€™ve saved time.
